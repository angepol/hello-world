# Project 1

# Traveller app #

=====================

Special Thanks to My instructors at GA for their help.

## Project 1 for General Assembly's 12 week Software Engineering Immersive ##

### This project uses 3 models with associations, CRUD systems, user logins, authentication, Ruby Gems, Map box API.

### Traveller - the project's aim ###


I felt inspired to create a travel app that allowed users to Plan, Blog and share their adventures.
A user can create a 'Journey' and add 'steps' along the way to document their adventure.
The can upload photos to each step.

In the Journeys Show page we see a display of each step on that journey with point marked on the map.
I have used Map Box for their beautifully designed maps that add to the user experience.
I used the gem 'geocoder' to ensure the longitude and latitude were accounted for when the user input a location.
This enabled a marker and a popup to be displayed.
